# Optimal-Scheduling-for-Charging-and-Discharging-of-Electric-Vehicles

This project develops an optimal scheduling algorithm to minimize the total cost for charging and discharging of electric vehicles.

To run the program:

1. Set up CVX (Matlab Software for Disciplined Convex Programming)

1). Download CVX tool from: http://cvxr.com/cvx/download/

2). Unpack CVX package into c:\cvx-lib\

3). In Matlab command window: cd ('C:\cvx-lib\cvx')

4). In Matlab command window: cvx_setup

2. Run the main program: G_Main_cvx.m
